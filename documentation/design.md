# ![White king](assets/wK.png) Chess Engine & GUI

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a robust chess engine that implements basic
[computer chess](https://www.chessprogramming.org) ideas and strategies.

In addition, we will develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate interaction
with the engine, allowing us to play games and assist with testing during development.
The primary purpose of the GUI is to streamline the development process, making it easier
to test, debug, and optimize the engine's performance.
